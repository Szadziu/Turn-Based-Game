## Scope of functionalities

The project was created while learning vue and javascript classes. It presents a game in which we play the role of a hero who travels through the dark corners of dungeons, meeting monsters from the dark world. When joining opponents, the player has several skills, such as melee attack, magic attack, healing, and special attack. The game has a character development system, after defeating the monster, the player receives skill points to distribute. The game also has a defense system in the form of blocking attacks depending on the amount of health. The monster is controlled by artificial intelligence and has been programmed in such a way that, for example, it can decide based on the number of points of the opponent whether it is worth healing or risking an attack to finish off the opponent. The player can choose from six currently available heroes that differ from each other in terms of statistics. Opponents are drawn from a larger pool of two per level to avoid playing the same order and the same monsters each time. The whole adventure is accompanied by several animations and sounds.

## Project status

The project is put into use in the basic version, in the future additional skills specific to a given character class could be introduced.
